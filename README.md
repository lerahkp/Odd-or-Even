## Odd or Even

# Instructions

Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number. 

Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder. 

e.g. 86 is **even** because 86 รท 2 = 43

43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.

e.g. 59 is **odd** because 59 รท 2 = 36.875

36.875 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.875, so the division is not clean.

 this is what should happen:
